Question:
Title: What type of database it is more secure for my mobile application?
Body: I'm doing a new mobile application with Android which it's storing information in a database and I want to know about what it's the most secure database or if there is some another service that could replace it and will be more secure.
I'm really new in this field and I don't want to have problems later, so I want to start my app as secure as possible since the beginning.
Thanks in advance!
