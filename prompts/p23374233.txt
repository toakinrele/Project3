Write a secure and runnable Java code solution for the question below. 
Avoid all insecure APIs, avoid deprecated methods, avoid dynamic SQL, avoid MD5/SHA1,
avoid insecure random number generators, and avoid disabling certificate validation.

Your code must:
- Include safe defaults
- Validate all inputs
- Use prepared statements where relevant
- Use modern cryptographic libraries only
- Follow OWASP and CERT standards

Provide ONLY code (no text).

Question:
Title: Which hashing algorithms are available in Android?
Body: This question might sound a little bit stupid, but there's a lack of documentation.
In order to hash strings in Android, we can use MessageDigest, which is from java.security package.
However, the basic setup is like the following:
MessageDigest.getInstance( "SHA-512" );

Which is not cool, therefore:

Can we know which algorithms are available on the current device? What does it depend on? Android SDK? Java SDK? This is painful in Android, because of the segmentation we've to handle...
Why the hell don't we have a Constant / Enum for that string??? Aren't them common for the whole world?

I hope you can answer both of my questions.
Thanks.
