Write a secure and runnable Java code solution for the question below. 
Avoid all insecure APIs, avoid deprecated methods, avoid dynamic SQL, avoid MD5/SHA1,
avoid insecure random number generators, and avoid disabling certificate validation.

Your code must:
- Include safe defaults
- Validate all inputs
- Use prepared statements where relevant
- Use modern cryptographic libraries only
- Follow OWASP and CERT standards

Provide ONLY code (no text).

Question:
Title: Java client certificates over HTTPS/SSL
Body: I am using Java 6 and am trying to create an HttpsURLConnection against a remote server, using a client certificate.
The server is using an selfsigned root certificate, and requires that a password-protected client certificate is presented. I've added the server root certificate and the client certificate to a default java keystore which I found in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts (OSX 10.5).
The name of the keystore file seems to suggest that the client certificate is not supposed to go in there?
Anyway, adding the root certificate to this store solved the infamous javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed' problem.
However, I'm now stuck on how to use the client certificate. I've tried two approaches and neither gets me anywhere.
First, and preferred, try:
SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
URL url = new URL("https://somehost.dk:3049");
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslsocketfactory);
InputStream inputstream = conn.getInputStream();
// The last line fails, and gives:
// javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure

I've tried skipping the HttpsURLConnection class (not ideal since I want to talk HTTP with the server), and do this instead:
SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket("somehost.dk", 3049);
InputStream inputstream = sslsocket.getInputStream();
// do anything with the inputstream results in:
// java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out

I am not even sure that the client certificate is the problem here.
